Describe Event Bubbling
A button is clicked and the event is directed to the button. If an event handler
is set for that object, the event is triggered.If no event handler is set to that 
object, the event bubbles up to the objects parents.
The event bubbles up from parent to parent until it is handled, or until it reaches
the document object.
